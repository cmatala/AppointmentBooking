# Faculty Appointment Booking System

The Faculty Appointment Booking System is a Java program designed to facilitate appointment scheduling between students and teachers. This system allows students to schedule appointments with their teachers during specific class periods within the school day. Each appointment has a duration, and the teacher must have a consecutive block of available minutes that meets or exceeds the requested duration.

## Features 

Appointment Scheduling: Students can request and schedule appointments with their teachers.
Class Periods: Appointments can be scheduled during one of eight class periods numbered 1 through 8.
Duration Management: The program checks for the availability of consecutive minutes within a class period to accommodate the requested duration.
Time Constraints: Appointments must start and end within the same class period.
